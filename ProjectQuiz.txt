What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.
A network of servers that distribute a large amount of data across the internet.
-the codes that are shared in the libraries make data easier to access, there's less of a need for the servers to load information that is already readily available
-since the content of the libraries overlap, the size of packages that need to be sent are smaller
-since the information needed to get the client side up and running is easier to access the amount of time spent on loading the site is smaller.
- easier to maintain, if the shared content of the libraries are distrubruted by a shared network then it's easier to update said network with new information rather than indivudually.
